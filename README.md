## Objective

Learn:

- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree


## Description

This project is meant to help us understant how to implement a binary tree

## Requirements

-   Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are allowed to use the standard library
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo (if you do we wonâ€™t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called binary_trees.h
- Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded

## Types of binary trees

### 1. Strict binary tree: A binary tree is called strict binary tree if each node has either two children or no children.

### 2. Full binary tree: A binary tree is called full binary tree if each node has exactly two children and all leaf nodes have no children.

### 3. Complete binary tree: A binary tree is called a complete binary tree if all the levels are completely filled except the lowest one which is filled from left.

## Properties of a Binary Trees
- The number of nodes(n) in a full binary tree is 2^(h+1).
- The number of leaf node in a full binary tree is 2^h.
- A binary tree of n nodes has (n+1) null references.
- The minimum and the maximum height of a binary tree having n nodes are âŒˆlog2nâŒ‰ and n, respectively.

## Structure of a Binary Tree
In a binary tree, each node has three part i.e., data, pointer to left child and pointer to right child.
